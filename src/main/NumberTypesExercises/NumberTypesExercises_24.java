/**
 * Write a Java program to check if a number is palindrome or not. Go to the editor
 * In number system a palindromic number is a number that is the same when written forwards or backwards, i.e., of the form .
 * The first few palindromic numbers are therefore are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, â€¦
 *
 * Expected Output
 * Input a number: 5
 * It is a Palindrome number.
